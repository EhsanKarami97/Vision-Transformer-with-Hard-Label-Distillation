- Developed a Python implementation of Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture integrated with hard label distillation to improve model performance.

- The model leverages a teacher-student framework, where the Vision Transformer acts as the student network, learning from the hard labels generated by the teacher model.

- Demonstrated improvements in image classification tasks.
